### B2B-Portal-Frontend

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Folder Structure

Each feature has it's own folder (auth),
Shared code such as services, interfaces/Models, Guards, Helpers are placed in folders prefixed with an underscore _ to easily differentiate them from features

Map refactoring to be done once the integration is complete


## Tileset types
    - Boundary files refer to the geojson coming from the backend
    
## Conventions

- Do not expose a Subject outside of service/component to avoid multiple stream values.
